# Watermark-image-embedding-and-detection-using-Residual-Neural-Network
Watermarks are simply patterns, images, or text placed in an image by an editor or producer to demarcate ownership. They are often used by stock image aggregators, such as Getty Images, to ensure that their company is given due credit for the image they collected Most Images found on the internet are either png or jpg file. They both can be represented by multi-dimensional matrices, with the pixels of the image being stored in varying levels of the matrix corresponding to its composition and coloration. A water mark is an alteration of these pixels, and, depending on the size and type of the watermark, their change to the pixel-composition can vary from slight to significant. In my project the mechanism is to gather the images add the watermark with sample images .Train the images then classify the image if image contains watermark then this should  be classify either protected image or Not protected image below the block diagram shows the total process.
First process is to collect and add water mark with the images then save folders training , testing and validation then send to the neural network then train the images then give some sample images to test it classify that contains watermark or not.
